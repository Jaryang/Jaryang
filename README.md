 ### 🌎 [Crisis Risk Dashboard (CRD) - a Data Analytics and Visualization platform for Socioeconomic Risk Analysis ](https://data.undp.org/products/crisis-risk-dashboard)

> ### Overview
>
> Proudly, when I worked as a data scientist at United Nations, I supported the development of Crisis Risk Dashboard (CRD). The Crisis Risk Dashboard (CRD) is a data analytics and visualization platform developed by UNDP's Crisis Bureau. The CRD's primary function is to monitor and analyze multidimensional contextual risks, with the objective of informing anticipatory decision-making by UNDP and the wider UN system. Evidence-based analysis supported by the CRD helps prevent crisis and address fragility at global, regional, national and sub-national levels.

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Risk & Development Monitoring:** Provides short-term monitoring and long-term trend analysis for all countries.  
- **Multi-Source Data Integration:** Captures global risk indices, newsfeeds, event-based data, and UNDP programme information.  
- **User-Friendly Visualization:** Translates complex data into interactive and visual formats for easy interpretation.  
- **Intranet Accessibility:** Available to all UNDP staff via the internal network.  
- **Customized Country & Regional Analysis:** Tailored Country Risk Dashboards (CRDs) provide in-depth, context-specific insights.  
- **Collaborative & Interagency Sharing:** Country CRDs facilitate information sharing and joint analysis across UN Country Teams.

### 🥘 [cappyfoodies - Food Accessibility and Security in Cook County](https://github.com/Jaryang/cappyfoodies)

> ### Overview
>
> According to the United States Department of Agriculture, food insecurity is “a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food” (USDA). This project visualized and explored patterns between the following key components affecting food insecurity. Since 1 in 4 children in Cook County are at risk of hunger, we hope that our application can help educate people about food accessibility as it is a critical health issue.

### Key Insights Included
- **Food Access (Proximity to food)**
- **Food Quality**
- **Food Type**
- **Restaurant Cleanliness**
- **Socioeconomic Factors**

### 🏥 [Disease Detection - Predicting Pneumonia from X-Ray Image](https://github.com/Jaryang/Pneumonia-Prediction-from-X-Ray)

> ### Overview
>
> In this project, we aim to develop a deep learning algorithm to diagonalize pneumonia from chest x-ray images of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center. We developed an AI solution for pneumonia detection from 5,800+ X-ray images, where we utilized image augmentation and crafted a custom Convolutional Neural Network model with PyTorch, achieving 93.75% accuracy. This project aims for a notable societal impact by streamlining disease detection in healthcare.

### 🗣️ [Social Network Analysis and Media Analytics - Political Influencer Extraction and Topic Modeling](https://github.com/Jaryang/Poli_KOL/blob/main/pj-paper.pdf)

> ### Overview
>
> In China, the influences of social media have widely permeated through people’s lives and the emergence of key opinion leaders (KOLs) in cyberspace greatly strengthens the information-spreading effects via social media. This project discerns the strategies taken by political key opinion leaders (KOLs) to shape their community influences from the politics-related forum section on Weibo, one of the biggest social media in China. Based on the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) modeling, relevant tweets under this section were integrated to construct a tweet corpus, from which 9 topics were derived.
> Meanwhile, community detection was further performed to find out the top 10 most influential KOLs under the section. Combining topic modeling and community detection, the strategy that was taken by the KOLs to shape their influences was fathomed based on qualitative analyses: On one hand, KOLs particularly concentrated on ongoing political affairs related to bilateral politics with clear biases to express their opinions. On the other hand, topics that were chosen by these key opinion leaders are close to the daily lives of normal people, ensuring strong realisticity and understandability to immerse target users in the discussion.
